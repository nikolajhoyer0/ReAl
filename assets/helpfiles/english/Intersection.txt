Intersection: ∩

Usage:
Intersection is used to produce a bag intersection of two multisets. Both sets must have exactly the same columns/attributes. Remove duplicates (δ) can be used along with intersection to create a regular set.

Notation:
R1 ∩ R2, where a1=b1,a2=b2,...,an=bn in the relations R1(a1,a2,...,an) and R2(b1,b2,...,bn).

Example:
Using the relations R1 and R2, R1 ∩ R2 will return those rows/tuples of R1 that are also in R2.
