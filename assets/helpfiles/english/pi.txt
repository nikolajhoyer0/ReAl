Projection π

Usage:
    Projection is used to produce a subset of the Columns/Attributes from the original relation.

Notation:
    In General:
        Using the relation R(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)
        π a_1, a_2, a_n R
        Will return the three columns a_1, a_2, a_n R

Example: A Relation R contains name address and phone numbers of students enrolled in a relational algebra course. R(name, address, phoneNumber). We wish to create a list of name and phone numbers to use when the course is cancelled.
"π name, phoneNumber R" will create said list with all names and phone numbers in R.
