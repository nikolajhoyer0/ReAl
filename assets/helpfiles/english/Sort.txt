    Sort is used to sort a table/relation by a single column/attribute. Only one column/attribute can be sorted at a time. Numbers are sorted in descending order, while strings are sorted lexicografically, in ascending order.

Notation:
    In general:
        Using the relation R(a1,a2,...,an)
        τ a2 R
        will return R sorted by a2.
