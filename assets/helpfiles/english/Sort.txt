Sort: τ

Usage:
Sort is used for sorting a table/relation by a single column/attribute. Only one column/attribute can be sorted at a time. Numbers are sorted in descending order, while strings are sorted lexicographically, in ascending order.

Notation:
τ Column Relation

Example:
Using the relation R(a1,a2,...,an), τ a2 R will return R sorted by a2.
