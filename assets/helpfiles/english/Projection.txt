Projection: π

Usage:
Projection is used for producing a subset of the Columns/Attributes from the original relation.

Notation:
π Column Relation

Example:
Using the relation R(a1,a2,...,an), π (a1, a2, an) R will return the three columns a1, a2 and an from R.

A Relation R contains name address and phone numbers of students enrolled in a relational algebra course. R(name, address, phoneNumber). We wish to create a list of name and phone numbers to use when the course is cancelled.
"π name, phoneNumber R" will create said list with all names and phone numbers in R.
