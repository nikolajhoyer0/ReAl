Union ∪

Usage:
    Union is used to produce a bag union of two multisets. Both sets must have exactly the same columns/attributes. Remove duplicates δ can be used along with union to create a regular set.

Notation:
    In general:
        Using the relations R(a1,a2,...,an) and S(b1,b2,...,bn)
        R ∪ S will return:
            RS( ? )
