Union: ∪

Usage:
Union is used to produce a bag union of two multisets. Both sets must have exactly the same columns/attributes. Remove duplicates (δ) can be used along with union to create a regular set.

Notation:
R1 ∪ R2, where a1=b1,a2=b2,...,an=bn in the relations R1(a1,a2,...,an) and R2(b1,b2,...,bn).
